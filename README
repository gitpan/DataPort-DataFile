1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. As established by
    the Perl referenced documents, program modules, such the
    "DataPort::DataFile" module, extends the Perl language.

    The "DataPort::DataFile" program module accesses different types of data
    sources in different formats and streams them to a stanadard pure Perl
    API.

    The dependency of the program modules in the US DOD STD2167A bundle is
    as follows:

     File::Package 
       File::TestPath File::SmartNL
          Test::STD::Scrub
            Test::Tech
               DataPort::FileType::FormDB DataPort::DataFile DataPort::Maker Test::STD::Template
                 Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

    Note the File::FileUtil, Test::STD::STDutil Test::STD::Scrub program
    modules breaks up the Test::TestUtil program module and Test::TestUtil
    has disappeared.

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases DataPort::DataFile version 0.02 providing
    description of the inventory, installation instructions and other
    information necessary to utilize and track this release.

        Hello, Samson Monaco Tutankhamen! Thanks for uploading your works to
        CPAN.

        I noticed that the test suite seem to fail without these modules:

        STD::Tester

        As such, adding the prerequisite module(s) to 'PREREQ_PM' in your
        Makefile.PL should solve this problem. For example:

         WriteMakefile(
            AUTHOR      => 'Samson Monaco Tutankhamen (support@SoftwareDiamonds.com)',
            ... # other information
            PREREQ_PM   => {
                'STD::Tester'   => '0', # or a minimum workable version
            }
         );

        If you are interested in making a more flexible Makefile.PL that can
        probe for missing dependencies and install them,
        ExtUtils::AutoInstall at
        <http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=ExtUtils-AutoInstall> may be
        worth a look.

        Thanks! :-)

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        CORRECTIVE ACTION:

        The Makefile.PL is automatically generated by ExtUtils::SVDmaker
        from the data stored in the DataPort::FileType::FormDB format in the
        Docs::Site_SVD::DataPort-FormDB module. For now, in
        Docs::Site_SVD::DataPort-FormDB

        Changed

         PREREQ_PM: ^

        to

         PREREQ_PM:
         'Test::TestUtil' => 0,
         'Test::Tester' => 0,
         ^

        and regenerated the distribution using ExtUtils::SVDmaker

        Uploaded Test::TestUtil and Test::Tester to CPAN in order to resolve
        the prerequiste.

    DataPort_FormDB 0.03
        Resolved a CPAN namespace conflict by changing the name of
        Test::Tester to Test::Tech.

    DataPort_FormDB 0.04
        Changed the name of "Test::Tester" to "Test::Tech". The name
        "Test::Tester" is taken on CPAN as an upload.

        Broke up the STD support utilities "Test::TestUtil" into
        "File::FileUtil", "Test::STD::Scrub" and "Test::STD::STDutil"

        Theses changes impacted the test software.

    DataPort_FormDB 0.05
        *   Broke "DataPort::DataFile" away into its own module. Move the
            "DataPort::DataFileI" test interface module to
            "t::DataPort::DataFileI".

            \item *

            Added a modest amount of new documentation to
            "DataPort::DataFile" Still have a long ways to go to finish up.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. Installation sites running Microsoft
    Operating systems require the installation of Unix utilities. An
    excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft operating
    systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring. A copy is available at the
    following web sites:

     http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
     http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

    There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of
    configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
    installation particular to any installation site.
